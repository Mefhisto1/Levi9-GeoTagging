# Levi9-GeoTagging
Internal project for Levi9 interns.

Levi9 has grown in past years to a point where we have a very large work force, that keeps shifting around (each project assembles its own winning team). It becomes difficult to keep track where each of our friends is at the time. Not easy to keep track of the teams as well.

To solve this, and to use one device we all have, which is a mobile phone, a geo tagging solution for Levi9 building needs to be built.

This application will consist of the following high level parts:
•	Server side, called keeper
•	Client side, mobile, called sensor

For the time being, to keep things simple, we need to establish a single goal: detect where each sensor is at any given time, and stream its location to keeper and any other sensor interested. 
To keep it even simpler, due to time constraints, we track only the conference rooms.
